Overview

I have spent the last three years building a brand centered around yoga and wellness under my name, Brittany L Hill 
and the event experience I created, Back Trap Yoga. The app that I'm creating will be along the lines of a Wikipedia for yoga, 
a means to search and find yoga poses that will include yoga pose breakdown videos. I did some basic user research with my 
audience to gauge what things they were looking to see from me to fulfill their needs around yoga and wellness. Yoga pose 
videos were highly requested. This app will provide a platform that allow users to connect further by being able to 
experience my alignment cues anywhere they can connect to the app. The app will include yoga pose videos and gives 
students the opportunity to "take me anywhere" and get the key cueing they would receive if they were in person in class. 
The app allows them to maintain consistency in their practice while being able to explore poses at their own pace in the 
comfort of their own space.
